## üì¶ Download Options

AntiSpoof is available in two versions to suit different server setups:

### Full Version (Recommended for most users)
- **All-in-one package** with PacketEvents included
- No additional plugins required
- Simple drop-in installation
- Larger file size but simpler setup

### Lite Version (For advanced setups)
- **Requires external [PacketEvents 2.7.1+](https://github.com/retrooper/packetevents) installation**
- Significantly smaller file size
- Prevents duplicate PacketEvents instances
- Ideal for servers already using plugins that depend on PacketEvents
- Better for performance on servers with multiple PacketEvents-based plugins

Both versions provide identical functionality - the only difference is whether PacketEvents is included in the JAR file or needs to be installed separately.

## üéØ What AntiSpoof Can Do

AntiSpoof is designed to catch the vast majority of cheaters who don't properly spoof their client brand or channels:

### 1. Detect Obvious Spoofers
Most hacked clients (like Wurst, Meteor, Impact, etc.) don't properly spoof their brand or channel information. Their modifications often leave telltale signs that AntiSpoof can easily detect.

### 2. Enforce Vanilla-Only Policies
Identify players who claim to be using "vanilla" but have registered plugin channels (which is technically impossible with a true vanilla client).

### 3. Block or Whitelist Specific Clients
Use powerful regex patterns to control exactly which client brands and channels are allowed on your server, giving you granular control over which modifications are permitted.

### 4. Protect Against Geyser Spoofing
Detect Java players who attempt to disguise themselves as Bedrock players to bypass security measures.

### 5. Create Custom Security Policies
The flexible configuration system allows you to tailor the plugin to your specific server's needs, from extremely strict (vanilla only) to more permissive (allowing certain mods).

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What AntiSpoof Cannot Do

Due to Minecraft's inherent limitations, there are some things that AntiSpoof cannot detect:

### 1. Stop Sophisticated Spoofers
A determined cheater with a custom client can spoof both their client brand and channels to perfectly mimic a vanilla client. However, such sophisticated spoofing is extremely rare and requires significant technical knowledge.

### 2. Detect VPNs or Alt Accounts
AntiSpoof focuses on client-side detection and does not include IP-based or account-based checks. For these protections, you would need additional security plugins.

### 3. Replace a Full Anti-Cheat
AntiSpoof is not designed to detect in-game cheats like fly hacks, kill aura, or other movement/combat hacks. It complements traditional anti-cheat plugins but does not replace them.

### 4. Guarantee 100% Protection
No anti-cheat solution can provide absolute protection. AntiSpoof is a powerful layer in your security stack but works best when combined with other protective measures.

---

## üí™ Why AntiSpoof is the Best Solution

Despite the limitations, AntiSpoof remains one of the most effective tools for detecting modified clients:

### 1. Catches 95% of Spoofing Cheaters
The vast majority of cheaters don't use sophisticated spoofing techniques. AntiSpoof catches these players easily, blocking most hacked clients with minimal false positives.

### 2. Highly Customizable
Every server has different needs. AntiSpoof's extensive configuration options allow you to tailor the plugin precisely to your requirements, from very strict to more permissive.

### 3. Specialized Use Cases
Whether you want to block non-vanilla clients entirely, enforce specific mod policies, or just protect against Geyser spoofing, AntiSpoof has you covered with targeted detection methods.

### 4. Realistic Expectations
AntiSpoof acknowledges Minecraft's limitations and focuses on what *can* be done effectively rather than making unrealistic promises. This honesty and transparency is why server owners trust it.

### 5. Lightweight & Efficient
Designed with performance in mind, AntiSpoof has minimal impact on your server's resources while providing robust protection.

## üîÑ PlaceholderAPI Integration

AntiSpoof integrates with PlaceholderAPI to provide useful placeholders for other plugins. This allows you to display client information on scoreboard plugins, tab list plugins, chat formatting plugins, and more.

### Available Placeholders

| Placeholder | Description | Example Output |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| `%antispoof_brand%` | Shows the player's client brand | "vanilla", "fabric", "lunarclient:v1.8.9-10b0" |
| `%antispoof_channels%` | Shows a comma-separated list of player's registered channels | "minecraft:brand, fabric:registry/sync, fabric:screen-handler-api" |
| `%antispoof_channels_count%` | Shows the number of registered channels | "5" |
| `%antispoof_is_spoofing%` | Returns whether the player is detected as spoofing | "true" or "false" |
| `%antispoof_is_bedrock%` | Returns whether the player is detected as a Bedrock player | "true" or "false" |

### Usage Examples

Here are some examples of how you can use these placeholders:

#### Chat Format (with a chat plugin)
```
[%antispoof_brand%] %player_name%: %message%
```

#### Welcome Message (with an essentials-like plugin)
```
&aWelcome! &7You're using &e%antispoof_brand%&7 with &e%antispoof_channels_count%&7 plugin channels.
```

#### Custom Scoreboard
```
&6‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê &bServer Info &6‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê
&7Client: &e%antispoof_brand%
&7Channels: &e%antispoof_channels_count%
&7Bedrock: &e%antispoof_is_bedrock%
&6‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê
```

### Setup Instructions

1. Ensure PlaceholderAPI is installed on your server
2. No additional setup required - AntiSpoof registers its placeholders automatically
3. Use the placeholders in any PlaceholderAPI-compatible plugin

## üî¨ How It Works

AntiSpoof uses multiple detection techniques to identify clients attempting to bypass security measures:

### 1. Client Brand Analysis
When a player joins, they send their client brand as a packet (e.g., "vanilla", "forge", "fabric"). AntiSpoof captures this information and compares it against your configured whitelist or blacklist.

### 2. Plugin Channel Registration
Modified clients register plugin channels to communicate with the server. A true vanilla client has no plugin channels, so any client claiming to be "vanilla" but registering channels is spoofing.

### 3. Pattern Matching
Sophisticated regex pattern matching allows AntiSpoof to identify specific client types or block certain patterns, even when clients try to disguise themselves.

### 4. Bedrock Authentication
For Geyser/Floodgate setups, AntiSpoof verifies Bedrock players either through the Floodgate API or by checking username prefixes, preventing Java players from pretending to be Bedrock users.

### 5. Dynamic Checks
After initial registration, AntiSpoof continues to monitor channel registrations, allowing it to detect clients that attempt to add suspicious channels later in the session.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Players Being Falsely Flagged
1. **Issue**: Legitimate players are being flagged as spoofers
   - **Solution**: Check your whitelist/blacklist settings. You may have blocked legitimate client brands. Enable debug mode to see what's triggering the flags.

#### No Alerts Being Sent
1. **Issue**: Players are spoofing but no alerts are appearing
   - **Solution**: Make sure staff have the `antispoof.alerts` permission and verify the plugin is properly enabled.

#### Discord Webhook Not Working
1. **Issue**: Alerts aren't being sent to Discord
   - **Solution**: Check your webhook URL, ensure it's correctly formatted, and verify that the `discord.enabled` setting is set to `true`.

#### Performance Concerns
1. **Issue**: Server lag after installing AntiSpoof
   - **Solution**: The plugin is very lightweight, but try increasing the `delay-in-seconds` value to spread out checks or disable the `debug` mode.

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode in the config.yml file to get detailed information about detected brands and channels:

```yaml
debug: true
```

This will log all client brands and channel registrations to your console, helping you identify what's triggering flags and adjust your configuration accordingly.

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: Which version should I use - Full or Lite?**  
A: Use the Full version for simplicity. Use the Lite version if you already have other plugins that use PacketEvents to avoid library duplication.

**Q: How does AntiSpoof handle Bedrock players?**  
A: It uses Floodgate API when available and falls back to username prefix checking. You can set the mode to "EXEMPT" or "IGNORE" in the config.

**Q: What's considered a vanilla client?**  
A: In Minecraft terms, a vanilla client is the unmodified game client from Mojang, which reports "vanilla" as its brand and has zero registered plugin channels.

**Q: Can AntiSpoof stop all cheaters?**  
A: No, but it can stop up to 95% of them depending on your setup. Sophisticated spoofing is rare and requires custom clients.

**Q: Does this work with ViaVersion?**  
A: Yes! AntiSpoof is fully compatible with ViaVersion and can even use ViaVersion's information to enhance its detection capabilities.

**Q: Will this block all modified clients?**  
A: This depends on your configuration. You can set it to block all non-vanilla clients, or you can whitelist specific client brands that you want to allow (like Lunar Client or Badlion).

**Q: How does this compare to traditional anti-cheat plugins?**  
A: AntiSpoof focuses specifically on client brand and channel detection, which is a different approach from movement/combat hack detection. It's best used alongside traditional anti-cheat plugins for complete protection.

### Technical Questions

**Q: Can players bypass this plugin?**  
A: Sophisticated hackers with custom clients can potentially bypass any detection method. However, the vast majority of cheaters don't go to those lengths.

**Q: Does AntiSpoof work with Velocity/BungeeCord/Waterfall?**  
A: AntiSpoof is designed for Spigot/Paper servers. While it works in a proxy environment, it should be installed on the backend servers, not on the proxy itself.

**Q: What are plugin channels?**  
A: Plugin channels are communication channels that mods and plugins use to exchange data between client and server. They're how most mods implement their functionality.

**Q: How do I add custom regex patterns?**  
A: Add your patterns to the `values` list under either `blocked-brands` or `blocked-channels`. For example, to block all Fabric mods, you might add `"(?i).*fabric.*"`.

**Q: What's the performance impact?**  
A: AntiSpoof is extremely lightweight. The checks only run when players join and when channel registration packets are sent, which is infrequent.
