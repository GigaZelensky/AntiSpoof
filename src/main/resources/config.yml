#                  AntiSpoof Configuration
# ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Welcome to AntiSpoof. This plugin helps server admins detect and manage 
# client-side modifications by analyzing client information sent by players.
#
# ⚠️ Note: While this plugin enhances security, it is not foolproof. 
# Skilled users can (ironically) spoof their client details to bypass detection.
#
# By default, the plugin only verifies whether a player claiming to use
# 'vanilla' has registered plugin channels, something that is impossible
# on a true vanilla client.
# ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# ⏳ Delay (in seconds) before checking for client spoofing.
# Set to 0 for an immediate check upon player login. (Default: 0)
delay-in-seconds: 0

# 🚫 Super Strict Mode (Not Recommended)
# Blocks players who either:
#    - Do NOT have a "vanilla" client, OR
#    - Have registered plugin channels (indicating mods/plugins)
# ⚠️ This is an extremely strict mode and may block legitimate players, 
#    so enabling it is usually unnecessary and could negatively impact your player base.
block-non-vanilla-with-channels: false

# 🔍 Validate client brand formatting.
# If enabled, the plugin checks for unusual characters in the client brand.

# 🛠️ Debug Mode
# If enabled, logs client channels and brand details in the console when a player logs in.
