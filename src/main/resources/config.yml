#                  AntiSpoof Configuration
# ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Welcome to AntiSpoof. This plugin helps server admins detect and manage 
# client-side modifications by analyzing client information sent by players.
#
# ⚠️ Note: While this plugin enhances security, it is not foolproof. 
# Skilled users can (ironically) spoof their client details to bypass detection.
#
# By default, the plugin only verifies whether a player claiming to use
# 'vanilla' has registered plugin channels, something that is impossible
# on a true vanilla client.
# ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# ⏳ Delay (in seconds) before checking for client spoofing.
# Set to 0 for an immediate check upon player login. (Default: 0)
delay-in-seconds: 0

# ️ Debug Mode
# If enabled, logs client channels and brand details in the console when a player logs in.
debug: false

#  Alert Messages
# Defines the message sent to players with the `antispoof.alerts` permission
# when a spoofing attempt is detected.
